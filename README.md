# streetlight

By this project we developed an intellegent streetlighting system using discrete components.The main aim of the project is to develop a streetlight which is automatically turns on when the predefined time arrives.Also the intensity of the street light is adjuted according to the intensity of the light.Also the lighting system detects the presense of the vehicle and turn on the light after a particular time interval.The status of the system is determined by the LCD display which is connected with the system.An ultrasonic sensor is used to determine the distance between the vehicle and the streetlight system.

COMPONENTS USED

Future Improvement.
We planned to make the system artificially intellegent by using some ai client such as wit.ai so that the admin can monitor the system from a centralised place.For that we decide to run a centralised server which controls the entire system and monitors it.The system is capable of taking decisions by its own.
